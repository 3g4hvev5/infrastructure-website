Title: Tips for Apache project email contributors

These tips provide guidance for etiquette on all Apache project mailing lists. A <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/#mail">site map for email info</a> is available.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This is a collection of tips for people  wishing to contribute to any 
<a href="../foundation/mailinglists.html">ASF Mailing Lists</a>.</p>
<h4 id="rightlist">Find the right list to use<a class="headerlink" href="#rightlist" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="public"></a>All user@, dev@ and most other mailing lists at Apache are 
publicly archived, and subject to our <a href="../foundation/public-archives.html">Public Forum Archive Policy</a>.</li>
<li><a name="appropriate-mailing-list" ></a>Send your comments to the appropriate mailing list. Well-directed
conversations are more productive and easier to find later. See <a href="../foundation/mailinglists.html">ASF
mailing lists</a> and the <a href="../foundation/preFAQ.html">Contact Apache
FAQ</a>.</li>
<li><a name="become-familiar" ></a>Become familiar with the mailing lists. As you browse and search, you
will see the way other people do things. Follow the leading examples.  </li>
<li><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/">Consult the archives</a> to see what's been done earlier.</li>
<li><a name="no-cross-posting"></a>Do not cross-post message. In other words, pick a mailing list and send
your messages to that mailing list only, not to multiple mailing lists. People may be subscribed to one
list and not to the other. Therefore, some people will only see part of the conversation, and some responses will appear on one list and others on another list.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nohtml">Do not send HTML<a class="headerlink" href="#nohtml" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><a name="do-not-send-html-mail"></a>Do not send HTML-only messages; send plain text (Content-type: text/plain) instead.
Sending HTML decreases the number of people who will read your email and is
the single most common cause of mail being rejected by the apache.org inbound
spam filtering. If your mail bounced and the error message said the spam
hits include <code>HTML_MESSAGE</code>, re-send the message as plain text.</p>
<p>Note that many modern systems, like GMail, are good about sending plain-text versions of your email to systems that prefer it.</p>
<h4 id="respect">Be respectful of other list participants<a class="headerlink" href="#respect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="conduct" ></a>All participants in Apache lists are expected to abide by our 
published <a href="/foundation/policies/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
<li><a name="respectful" ></a>Respectful and considerate communities are one of the pillars of the
Apache way. Please aim to provide constructive comments and do not
denigrate others.</li>
<li><a name="do-not-engage" ></a>Do not engage in personal attacks. That is not our way. If ever you see
one happening, then either help to defuse it or don't comment and let the
conversation die.</li>
<li><a name="do-not-use-you"></a>Try not to use the word "you". People get defensive when they think that
comments are directed at them personally. Consider using "one" or "we" or
even "me". Also stay away from "you said" then paraphrasing - too easy to
misinterpret their words. Try "from what I think I read", "AFAICT" (which stands for "as far as I can tell"), and similar phrases to reduce the possibility of confrontation or misunderstanding.</li>
<li><a name="use-general-list"></a>Direct your comments to the list in general, rather
than to any specific person, unless it is something like "@PersonName, your explanation really helped me solve my problem."</li>
<li><a name="avoid-gender"></a>Avoid the use of gender-specific terms like "he" or "she" simply by
writing better sentences: "Rene agreed to fix issue 542". To avoid "he or she", it is fine to use "they" even to refer to a single person.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="usefulq">How to write useful questions<a class="headerlink" href="#usefulq" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="research-topic"></a>Research your topic before beginning to discuss a new issue. Search and
browse through the email archives - your issue may have been discussed before. Do not just perceive a problem and then rush out with a question -
instead, become informed so you can either a) avoid asking a question altogether or b) provide a useful comment or question..</li>
<li><a name="clearly-explain"></a>Take the time to clearly explain your issue and write a concise email
message. Less confusion in the writing facilitates a faster and better response. Everyone
will benefit from the extra time on your part. The less unnecessary
discussion, the better.</li>
<li><a name="contribution-worthwhile"></a>Every contribution is worthwhile. Even if the ensuing discussion proves
it to be off-beam, it may jog ideas for other people.</li>
<li><a name="use-sensible"></a>Use sensible and concise email Subject: headings. Search engines, and
humans trying to browse a voluminous list, will respond favourably to a
descriptive title.</li>
<li><a name="topic-focused"></a>Keep each topic focused. If some new topic arises then start a new
discussion. This leaves the original topic to continue un-cluttered.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="patience">Patience: Open source is made of volunteer communities<a class="headerlink" href="#patience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="volunteer-basis" ></a>Most people participate in Apache projects on a volunteer
basis and in their "spare time". These enthusiasts will attempt to respond
to issues, but it may take a little while to get your answers.</li>
<li><a name="participants-busy" ></a>Most list participants are very busy. Their replies might appear to be
curt when they direct you to a document, or give a short answer without
niceties. If they spent too long preparing each reply, then they would
become exhausted.</li>
<li><a name="no-private-emails" ></a>Do not send development or use questions in private emails.
Keep the discussion on the mailing list, where we can all learn and assist each other.</li>
