Title: Localization

The <a href="https://translate.apache.org/" target="_blank">ASF Translation Service</a> provides the Pootle localization tool to help projects that want to provide documentation and user-interface text in multiple languages. *NOTE*: While several ASF projects continue to use Pootle, AFS is not approving new Pootle use. As of March, 2020, Infra is testing a replacement translation service.
