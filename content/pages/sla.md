Title: Service Level Agreement (SLA)

A service-level agreement, or SLA, is a service provider's commitment to its clients. The Infra team commits to these targets for the services it maintains for the Apache community.

For current status, see <a href="https://status.apache.org/" target="_blank">the ASF status page</a> and our <a href="https://www.apache.org/uptime/" target="_blank">SLA graphs</a>.

We divide Infra-provided services into four groups:

1. Critical

   Target: 99.5% uptime
   * email
   * version control (svn and git)
   * TLP websites
   * LDAP

1. Core

   Target: 99% uptime
   * issue trackers (Bugzilla and Jira)
   * bar

1. Standard

   Target: 95% uptime
   * foo
   * bar

1. None

   These services have no SLA.
   * foo
   * bar
