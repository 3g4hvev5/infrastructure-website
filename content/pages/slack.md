Title: Slack for ASF projects

The Apache Software Network has a workspace on <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> to provide channels on which people working on the same ASF project, or in the same area of the Foundation, can discuss issues, solve problems, and build community in real-time.

## Joining the ASF Slack workspace ##

Membership in the ASF Slack workspace is by invitation. If you are a new participant in an ASF project, ask someone on the PMC to invite you to Slack if you want to take part in the discussions there.

## Joining project channels ##

Once you are part of the ASF workspace, you can join any open channels you wish to. 

 - At the top of your list of channels in the Slack app, click the **+** icon
 - Use the _Browse channels_ option to display a list of open channels in the workspace; or enter text in the search field.
 - Select any channel to add it to your channel list.
 
 Some ASF channels are **private** or **locked**, and do not appear on the list of channels you can join. Someone with the appropriate rights has to join you to such a channel.
 
 It is good manners to send a hello message to the channel, possibly with a short statement of why you are there.


## Setting up a project channel ##

Before setting up a new project channel, search the ASF workspace to make sure it does not already exist. If it does not, any member of the workspace can add the channel.

  - At the top of your list of channels in the Slack app, click the **+** icon
  - Use the _Browse channels_ option to see if the channel you are thinking of already exists. If you can't find it, click _Create Channel_ at the top of the channels list; or use the _Create a channel_ option under the + icon.

If you _do_ add a channel for your project, make sure you tell the PMC, committers, and other stakeholders about it so they can find and make use of it.


## Expectations ##

  - **Behavior**: We expect channel participants to be respectful and supportive of other participants, and make contributions that add to the conversation, rather than blurring it. If a participant makes contributions that are disrespectful, offensive, or contrary in other ways to The Apache Way, please report them to Infra.
  - **Decisions**: A thread in a Slack channel can be a great place to work through a knotty question and move toward consensus. However, coming to agreement about something on Slack does not mean the PMC has agreed to or approved something. All formal PMC decisions should take place in one of the project's email lists.
