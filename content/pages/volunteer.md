Title: Volunteering for Apache Infrastructure
Slug: volunteer

If you're a willing volunteer, who can tell the difference between a server and a hifi amp, this is for you! There are plenty of opportunities for you to help out with the small tasks that need to be done every day to keep the ASF Infrastructure alive. Some are self-explanatory, and you'll learn more about the rest of them as you get involved.

There are some basic things you should be able to do, if you're going to help out with the ASF Infrastructure team. You probably do them all already, in other ASF projects.

  - Read infrastructure mailing lists and be aware of what is going on. Read #asfinfra as well.
  - Work on documentation, especially procedural documentation and answers to FAQs. It is more effective if we can simply refer people to a webpage.
  - Answer questions that other people ask on infrastructure@. This is immensely beneficial to the rest of the team, as it allows them space to get on with other things.
  - Work through the Issue Tracker and submit patches, comments, links, etc, that may help in resolving them.
  - Look for support requests on infrastructure@ as they come in and volunteer to handle them.
  - Add entries to the Issue Tracker for issues raised via e-mail that are not yet being handled. We don't want them slipping through the cracks.
  - Work on in-house tasks. At any time there are several outstanding TODOs involving the in-house services, patches, and scripts; not everything is recorded on the issue tracker.
