Title: Getting started with Git

This document is a primer on using Git for an Apache Software Foundation project. 

There are two forms of Git repositories:

1. Read-only mirrors hosted at https://git.apache.org
2. Read/write repositories hosted at https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf

This document is chiefly about the read/write repositories.
