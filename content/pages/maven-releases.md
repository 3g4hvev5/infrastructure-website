Title: Publishing Maven Releases

_moving information here from `https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html`_

possibly include these fragments:

  - Don't try to publish `.sha256`, `.sha512` files yet; Nexus doesn't handle them (as of March 2018)
  = `.md5`s in `dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/` must be removed manually.
