Requesting a bug tracker for a project

Infrastructure offers two bug and issue tracking systems:

  - <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/" target="_blank">Jira</a>
  - <a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/" target="_blank">BugZilla</a>
  
Infra itself uses Jira, so to request a Jira or BugZilla instance for your project, create a <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA" target="_blank">Jira ticket</a> with the necessary details:

### Requesting a Jira instance ###

File a Jira ticket with INFRA using the link above, and set the issue type to `New Jira Project`. Supply at least the following information:

  - A list of committers with access to modify/close tickets
  - A list of committers who will act as Jira administrators
  - A notification scheme (to which email address do JIRA notifications go?)
  - A name and description for the Jira instance

### Requesting a BugZilla instance ###

The Jira bug tracker has the modern hooks and integrations that make it easier to work with. However, if your project would prefer a BugZilla instance file a Jira (haha) ticket with INFRA using the link above, and set the issue type to `New Bugzilla Project`. Supply at least the following information:

  - A list of committers with access to modify/close tickets
  - A list of committers who will act as BugZilla administrators
  - A notification scheme (to which email address do issue notifications go?)
  - A name and description for your BugZilla instance
  
### Response ###

Infra will respond within a couple of days, either with a request for clarification of some point or to let you know that the instance is set up and ready for your project to use.
