Title: Triage role for project repositories

Apache projects can assign the GitHub _triage_ role to PMC members, committers, and others with a vote link, to help with management of their code repository. 

A person with a triage role can 

  - apply labels to code
  - close, reopen, and assign issues and pull requests
  - apply milestones
  - mark duplicate issues and pull requests
  - request pull-request reviews
  
This is a more restricted role than "write", "maintain", or "admin". Git recommends the role "for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access." It is a good role for people who are interested in supporting and contributing to the project, but who are not ready to be Committers.
