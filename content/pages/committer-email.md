Title: Committer Email

Every Apache project committer account has an associated apache.org email address. Some official Apache emails go to these addresses, so you need to check your apache.org email regularly for announcements. You can also use this address for correspondence related to ASF projects you work on.

You cannot work directly with your Apache email address. You must set up **forwarding** for this address so you can read and write mail using it. Be sure to keep your forwarding address up to date.

## Setting up email forwarding ##

To get your Apache email address working smoothly, you need to 

- Register an _email alias_ to which Apache can forward mail that comes to your Apache inbox.
- Configure your email provider so you can _send mail_ from your Apache address.
