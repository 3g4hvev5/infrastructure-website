Title: Committer Email

Every Apache project committer account has an associated apache.org email address. Some official Apache emails go to these addresses, so you need to check your apache.org email regularly for announcements. You can also use this address for correspondence related to ASF projects you work on.

You cannot work directly with your Apache email address. You must set up **forwarding** for this address so you can read and write mail using it. Instructions on how to set up your forwarding address are below. Be sure to keep your forwarding address up to date.
