Title: Application upgrades policy and workflow

This policy encompasses Infra's approach to upgrades of Jenkins, Confluence and Jira and their respective plugins.

## Upgrades ##

### Jenkins ###

#### Main Jenkins instance ####
_Upgrades once a quarter_

Infra follows the <a href="https://jenkins.io/download/lts/" target="_blank">LTS line of releases</a>, which the Jenkins Project releases on a 12 week cycle. Once every three months, on the last Saturday or Sunday of the month following the Jenkins LTS release, ASF Infra upgrades the main instance. 

#### Jenkins plugins ####
_Upgrades once a month_

We upgrade all plugins before and after the main instance upgrade, as appropriate, and at the end of each month when there is no main instance upgrade to perform.

### Jira ###

#### Main Jira instance ####

#### Jira plugins ####

### Confluence ###

#### Main Confluence instance ####
