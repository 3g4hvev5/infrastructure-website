Title: Application upgrades policy and workflow

This policy encompasses Infra's approach to upgrades of Jenkins, Confluence and Jira and their respective plugins.

## Upgrades ##

### Jenkins ###

#### Main Jenkins instance ####
_Upgrades once a quarter_

Infra follows the <a href="https://jenkins.io/download/lts/" target="_blank">LTS line of releases</a>, which the Jenkins Project releases on a 12 week cycle. Once every three months, on the last Saturday or Sunday of the month following the Jenkins LTS release, ASF Infra upgrades the main instance. 

#### Jenkins plugins ####
_Upgrades once a month_

We upgrade all plugins (there are more than 200!) before and after the main instance upgrade, as appropriate, and at the end of each month when there is no main instance upgrade to perform.

### Jira ###


#### Main Jira instance ####
_Upgrades every six months_

Jira gets a new release every two to six weeks, far too often (and unpredictable) for us to upgrade every release they make. Infra upgrades our Jira instance to whatever the latest release is every six months.

#### Jira plugins ####
_Upgrades every two months_

We upgrade Jira plugins before or after each main instance upgrade, as appropriate, and once every two months between main instance upgrades. Here is a <a herf="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Jenkins+Plugin+Upgrades" target="_blank">list of all Jira plugins upgrades</a>.

### Confluence ###
