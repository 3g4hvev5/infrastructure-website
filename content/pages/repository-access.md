Title: Repository access policy


1. ASF projects are required to house their project code inside ASF supported services (svn, gitbox).
2. Only people with an ICLA on file with Apache can create, edit, or update code housed within the ASF. There is no third-party access to create, edit, or delete files.
3. Apache software projects are open-source, so everyone has **read** access to all code housed within the ASF.
4. Documentation is not code. Projects can host their documentation anywhere (such as on platforms like readthedocs and gitlab) and, if they choose, make them available to the world to create and edit pages.
5. However, if projects create and house their documentation inside the ASF, statement 2. applies to it.
