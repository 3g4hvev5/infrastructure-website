Title: Release Distribution Policy

This policy governs how Apache software releases are distributed through the technical channels maintained by Apache Infrastructure (Infra). It complements the formal Apache Release Policy, which defines what must be in a software release, and the Release Process which describes the steps for a PMC member to create a release.
