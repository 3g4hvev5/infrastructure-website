Title: Apache and GitHub

The ASF has a <a href="https://github.com/apache" target="_blank">presence on GitHub</a>. If you wish to join the organisation as a member on GitHub, visit `https://id.apache.org` and set your githubUsername LDAP field to your GitHub ID. You should be added to the organisation within four hours.

Can I write to repositories at GitHub ?
If your project is currently hosted on Gitbox then you can push to GitHub.

To move to GitHub as master follow the steps below:

Add yourself to our GitHub organization (see above) and make sure you are already a committer for the relevant project
Visit the Gitbox Site and link your GitHub account with your ASF account
Wait about an hour for things to sync up
You now have r/w access to both gitbox.apache.org and GitHub!
