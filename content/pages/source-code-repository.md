Title: Source Code Repositories at Apache

Apache project contributors are in countries all around the world. To help them work together, projects keep their source code in an Internet-accessible revision control system, either <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank">Subversion (SVN)</a> or <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>. Apache committers have _write access_ to the repositories for their projects, so they can edit existing code and add new files. 

Everyone has _read access_ to the repositories and can download the most up-to-date development version of any project's software to review or compile. If you want a stable release of the source code, download it from the <a href="https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/" target="_blank">distribution directory</a>. 

If you want a release version of the project's compiled application, visit the project's website and find its download page. It may offer both stable releases and "bleeding-edge" or "nightly" builds

There are several ways to access the Apache project repositories:
