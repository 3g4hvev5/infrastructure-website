Title: Source Code Repositories at Apache

Apache project contributors are in countries all around the world. To help them work together, projects keep their source code in an Internet-accessible revision control system, either <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank">Subversion (SVN)</a> or <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>. Apache committers have _write access_ to the repositories for their projects, so they can edit existing code and add new files. 

Everyone has _read access_ to the repositories and can download the most up-to-date development version of any project's software to review or compile. 

- If you want a stable release of the source code, download it from the <a href="https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/" target="_blank">distribution directory</a>. 
- Only download the code directly from your project's code repository if you are participating in the development effort. The latest version of the code is what your colleagues have most recently checked in, and they may or may not have confirmed that it compiles correctly and does what they want it to do.
- If you want a release version of the project's compiled application, visit the project's website and find its download page. It may offer both stable releases and "bleeding-edge" or "nightly" builds that compile properly but include the latest, possibly-unstable, features.

## Git repositories ##
How-to guides, documentation, and a list of projects using git for revision control are at <a href="https://git.apache.org/" target="_blank">git.apache.org</a>.
