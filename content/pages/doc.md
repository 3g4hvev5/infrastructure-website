Title: Documentation

Infra provides a library of resources that is constantly evolving to reflect the current state of Apache's infrastructure and policies.

###Infra Wiki

The <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/" target="_blank">Infra Wiki</a> provides scripts, guidelines, how-to articles, and code samples. Most support the functions of the Infra team, but a great deal of material has guidance for project committers and PMCs.
