## Can I write to repositories at GitHub ?? ##

Currently, this is not an option for most projects.
Please push your commits to the ASF Git repos at git-wip-us.apache.org

If you are participating in the _MATT_ experiment, follow the steps below:

- Add yourself to our GitHub organisation (see above)
- Visit the [MATT Site](https://matt.apache.org/) and link your GitHub account with your ASF account
- Wait about an hours time for things to sync up
- Great, you now have r/w access to both git-dual and GitHub!
