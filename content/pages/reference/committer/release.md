Title: Releasing project packages
slug: reference/committer/release

- Development packages and snapshots should be uploaded to <https://dist.apache.org/dist/dev/$project/>
- Releases should be uploaded to <https://dist.apache.org/dist/release/$project/> (or moved via `svn mv` from the dev folder)

Incubator projects will find their dev/release folder inside the incubator directory.
Unless otherwise specified, only PMC members can act as release managers. 
If your project wishes to allow normal committers to release files, please 
[contact infrastructure](/committer/contact) with your request
