Title: Cryptography with OpenPGP

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
OpenPGP is encryption software. The program provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication, covering signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and increasing the security of e-mail communications.

Reliable cryptography applications follow OpenPGP, an open standard of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software, standard (RFC 4880), for encrypting and decrypting data.

The Apaches Software Foundation recommends using <a href="https://www.gnupg.org" target="_blank">Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)</a>, a well-known open source cryptography tool with OpenPGP support. Always use the latest version.

GnuPG has a good set of <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>. This guide covers only some important points.
