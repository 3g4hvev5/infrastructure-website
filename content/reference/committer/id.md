Title: Changing your account details (self serve)
slug: reference/committer/id

The ASF uses a self serve site for managing account information about committers.

The site can be found at: [https://id.apache.org](https://id.apache.org)

On this site, you can log on and change your credentials such as password, email, SSH key information
and more.


# Lost your password?

If you have misplaced or forgotten your password, you can reset it by following the instructions at:
[https://id.apache.org/reset/enter](https://id.apache.org/reset/enter).

This requires you to still have access to the email account associated with your Apache account.
A reset key is only valid for 15 minutes, so be sure to use it as soon as it arrives.

NOTE:  If you have added a GPG key to your account the password reset will be encrypted with that key, so you'll need extra intervention if you have lost/ forgotten that key.

# Locked out of the system?
If you have forgotten your password and cannot retrieve it, you should contact Infrastructure for
further information. This can be done via [root@apache.org](mailto:root@apache.org).

When asking for a manual password reset or email change, please consider the following:

- If you have access to an ASF machine via SSH (with a private key), you can use this to prove your identity.
- If you don't have access to anything to prove your identity, you may be asked to file a new ICLA to confirm
  your identity.
