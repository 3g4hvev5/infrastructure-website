# JIRA Tickets
The standard way to ask for work to be done is through our [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA) system.

## Prioritize your JIRA tickets right! ##
Please follow these guidelines when assigning a priority to JIRA tickets.
We actually use these priorities to triage operations, and if we feel a ticket is mis-prioritized, we __will__ change it or put it on hold.

- __Blocker__: A time-sensitive issue that is hindering a project in functioning on a basic level. <br/>_Examples_:
 - - Web site has been defaced and we just sent out a press release.<br/><br/>
- __Critical__: A time-sensitive issue that causes disruption for a project, but is not hindering the basic functionality <br/>_Examples_:
- - We just called a new release, but SVN is not allowing us to upload or
          move the artifacts.<br/><br/>
- __Major__: A (large) issue that is expected to be resolved fast, but is not time-sensitive in terms of basic project functionality. This includes asking for new resources to be set up. <br/>_Examples_:
 - - Set up a new podling.
 - - Add a git repository.
 - - Set up svn/git-pubsub.<br/><br/>
- __Minor__: An issue that is expected to be resolved within a medium amount of time, but is not time-sensitive nor critical to a projects basic functionality or ongoing daily business. <br/>_Examples_:
 - - Retire a project's resources.
 - - Fix a javascript error on a web site.
 - - Add GitHub integration for a repository.<br/><br/>
- __Trivial__: A task that should be solved, but has minimal or no constraints in time <br/>_Examples_:
 - - Fix copyright year on a web site.
