Title: Policy for Outreach to Committers

# Outreach
There are many situations where the Foundation, or groups within,
want to reach out to the many Committers who volunteer their time
to our many efforts.

# Coverage
Our Committers are most easily reached via the `committers@`
mailing list, but there may be occasions when it makes more
sense to send individual emails. This policy covers all
channels for reaching the Foundation's committers.
