<h2 id="requesting-podling">Requesting podling creation</h2>
<p>The podling creation process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IPMC vote passes.</li>
<li>The podling is added to the IPMC's <code>podlings.xml</code> summary file with <code>status=current</code>.
(See <a href="https://incubator.apache.org/guides/mentor.html#Overview" target="_blank">notes</a> about that, and other initial tasks.)</li>
<li>Create a &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA</a>&quot; targe&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jira ticket</a> asking Infra to create a DNS for your new podling (include the podling's name).</li>
<li>After the DNS is created, an ASF Member or PMC chair files <a href="https://selfserve.apache.org/mail.html" target="_blank">mailing list creation requests</a>.</li>
<li>Infra creates the lists, which also notifies the IPMC of the mailing list creation.</li>
<li>An Incubator PMC member who is also an ASF member or a PMC chair edits the <a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/modules/subversion_server/files/authorization/asf-authorization-template" target="_blank">asf-authorization-template</a> and adds an <code>[/incubator/podling]</code> section. If the section refers to an <code>@podling</code> group, add a definition of that group as a comma-separated list of availids (usernames), to the <code>[groups]</code> section.  Alternatively, just set <code>@incubator = rw</code> as the section's body.</li>
<li>If the podling wants to use SVN, an Incubator PMC member runs <code>svn mkdir ^/incubator/podling</code>. The commit
mail goes to the mailing list created earlier.</li>
<li>If the podling wants to use GIT, one of the mentors submits a request via <a href="https://selfserve.apache.org/" target="_blank">Self-Serve</a>.</li>
<li>The podling community sets up a <a href="https://infra.apache.org/project-site#intro" target="_blank">project site</a>.</li>
<li>An ASF Member or PMC chair files a <a href="https://home.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#infrastructure-root" target="_blank">website creation request</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the project needs additional services (issue tracker, Wiki, blog, etc.), file a ticket via <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA" target="_blank">Jira</a> using appropriate categories and providing as much information as possible. To save everyone's time, consult <a href="#what-we-need-to-know">&quot;Providing needed information&quot;</a>
before filing each ticket.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-graduation">Requesting podling graduation to top level project (TLP)</h2>
<p>Once your podling has <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html#project-first-steps">graduated</a> to a TLP, create the following Jira tickets:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a "Graduate Foo to TLP" parent ticket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a "Foo TLP: common tasks" ticket as a sub-task of (1).
This ticket will handle: DNS entry, Unix/LDAP group creation, PMC Chair karma,
mailing list migration, native Git repository migrations (but not git-svn
mirrors), Subversion public tree migration, buildbot config
changes, website migration.
<strong>There is no need to file individual tickets for these tasks.</strong>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
In the ticket, specify <strong>the LDAP name of the TLP</strong> --- that is, the 'foo' in 'dev@foo.apache.org'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each additional service that needs configuration changes as the result
of the migration, create another sub-task of (1).  (If you have N services,
create N sub-tasks.)  "Services" here
includes everything <a href="#requesting-menu">pointered below</a>, including (but not
limited to): Subversion private tree, git-svn mirrors, issue trackers,
wikis, <a href="http://ci.apache.org/">continuous integration</a> (Jenkins, Buildbot, Continuum etc.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5688">Flex's graduation tickets</a> for a good example.</p>
<p>Note that the new PMC chair is still responsible for using Whimsy as appropriate. 
The group membership is initialized on a best-guess basis, but the chair must check 
that it's accurate and add/rm people as needed. The Committee data, however, 
is initialized directly from the Board resolution and as such should be correct.</p>
<h2 id="regain-account">Regaining access to a committer account<a class="headerlink" href="#regain-account" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you forgot your password...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Try to reset it at <a href="https://id.apache.org/reset/enter">https://id.apache.org/reset/enter</a>.  That will email
your @apache.org address (which forwards to your non-apache email account) 
a short-lived password reset link.  (The link may be encrypted to <a href="https://home.apache.org/keys/committer/">your PGP
key</a>.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decrypting the e-mail - one way to do this is as follows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the e-mail contents as a text file, e.g. password.txt.
Open a shell command window, and run the following command:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>gpg -d password.txt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should decrypt the file and display the output in the window</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have lost access to your registered email address, you will need
to file an additional ICLA with Secretary. Follow the directions for <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#submitting">submitting 
an ICLA</a>. Include your current
Apache id on the ICLA and mention in your cover email that you are requesting
a change to your email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that didn't work, you need to email root@.  In your email, mention the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that you have tried a self-service password reset, and why it
  didn't work.  (Was the mail received?  Did you decrypt it successfully?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why you need to regain access to your Apache account --- e.g., if it is
  to work on a <a href="/foundation/">foundation project</a>, name that project; or if
  you are a <a href="/foundation/members">foundation member</a>, state that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you have SSH access to <code>minotaur.apache.org</code> (or to a PMC
  jail/zone/VM) via public-key authentication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you ever set up OPIE on any <code>*.apache.org</code> box.  (This is only
  applicable to people who had root on PMC VMs.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you have access to the private part of a PGP key associated with
  your Apache account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the contact information on your ICLA is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<a href="/foundation/members">ASF Members</a> only) Whether the contact information in your members.txt entry is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you are able to send a new ICLA, with the same signature as your
  original one, which specifies new contact information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether there is any other way in which we (infra) might satisfy
  ourselves that you --- a person asking us to reset the password
  of a given @apache.org account --- is the legitimate owner of that
  account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: please do not ask other ASF committers or Members to email root@ and
vouch for you.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-action">Other Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#requesting-action" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This section applies to everything from "add a moderator" through
"create an account for a committer" and up to "set up a new TLP".</p>
<h3 id="requesting-menu">What can I ask for?<a class="headerlink" href="#requesting-menu" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>See <a href="services">list of services</a> we run.  If you want something that isn't
listed, get in touch --- it might be possible to support it (especially if the
feature request is equipped with volunteers who will help maintain it ---
hint, hint).</p>
<h3 id="requesting-where">Where should I submit my request?<a class="headerlink" href="#requesting-where" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Briefly, if there is a <a href="https://selfserve.apache.org/">dedicated webapp</a>, use it;
if not, <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA">file a JIRA ticket</a>.  The
<a href="#how">complete answer</a> is in the table above.  Please read the table before
filing a ticket - often you or someone in your PMC can effect the change without
involving infra at all.</p>
<h3 id="request-checklist">Before you press <code>Send</code><a class="headerlink" href="#request-checklist" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do <strong>ask in your project</strong> whether someone has the karma to implement the
  requested change before asking infra.  (This eases the load on the infra
  team: we are a dozen volunteers looking after 100+ projects, so we delegate
  what we can.)  The moderators and volunteer admins of the project's issue
  tracker and wiki can often address issues with those services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do <strong>aggregate</strong> requests: instead of sending five emails each asking for
  one more moderator to be added, send one email asking for five moderators to
  be added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do <strong>CC your PMC</strong> on emails.  In JIRA tickets, it is helpful to link to a
  thread that demonstrates PMC consensus.  (If you request a significant or
  major configuration change, we will probably ask for that link if you don't
  provide it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you create a JIRA ticket, do create it in the right <strong>JIRA component</strong>.
  (If it's not obvious which component is the right one, it's a bug in the
  documentation.)  (This helps our volunteers efficiently spot outstanding
  tasks in their areas.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be <strong>patient</strong>. Remember that everyone is a volunteer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research</strong> your topic. See the <a href=".">developer information homepage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong>.  Making requests following these guidelines might be a little
  effort, but saves time for all involved.</p>
</li>

<p>Don't see here what you're looking for?  See above for <a href="#requesting-where">other
cases</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reopen">My issue got closed with a request to reopen it.<a class="headerlink" href="#reopen" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Then reopen it.  Usually we ask that you do something as you reopen it, so do
that too (or say why you didn't).</p>
<p>Background: we tend to close issues that are not actionable upon by us for an
extended period, since we use the <code>INFRA</code> queue as a todo list.  In our
workflow, this kind of close/reopen cycle is a matter of ordinary routing 
(much like <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/building#revert">reverting a commit that broke the build
system</a>).</p>
<h2 id="ignored">My issue got ignored.<a class="headerlink" href="#ignored" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There could be a few reasons: some areas are staffed mainly by
volunteers, so may have longer turn-around times (relative to other
areas); sometimes we're busy on backend projects (e.g., installing new
hardware via our remote hands) and have little time for user-facing
tasks; sometimes an issue blocks on prerequisite new hardware to get
shipped, installed, and configured, which takes time; sometimes
we're just backlogged and are working on issues ahead of yours in the
queue; and sometimes we do tickets of a certain category in batch, and
yours will be done in the next batch in a few days.</p>
<p>If you'd like to inquire as to the status and ensure your issue
doesn't get lost, feel free to add a comment to the relevant JIRA issue
(if any) to that effect, or email the <code>users@infra</code> list with a
question.  If the matter remains unresolved after that, feel free to
escalate the matter to <a href="/foundation/">the VP, Infrastructure</a> or to the
<code>operations@</code> privately-archived mailing list (everyone may post to it).</p>
<h2 id="emergency">In case of emergency<a class="headerlink" href="#emergency" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The following describes how to page root@ people when there is an absolutely
urgent problem, such as a malicious cracker having an active root shell on
archive.apache.org.  <strong>This is only intended for pressing, ASF-wide problems
that must be handled at once, even if that means waking people up in the middle
of the night or having them miss their flight.</strong></p>
<p>Normally, pinging <code>#asfinfra</code> or emailing <code>root@</code> or <code>private@infra</code>
suffices.  Pinging people privately (via email, Slack, or twitter) is generally
discouraged as then only a single person is aware of a request. .  If all of these
have been exhausted, or are not sufficiently timely, the last resort is to look 
up root@ people (see list of names <a href="http://home.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#infrastructure-root">here</a> or <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt">here</a>) and call them or SMS them.  </p>
<p>Finally, the VP Infrastructure has the authority to
contact third parties directly.  The contact information is available
to him via <code>docs/vp/littleblackbook.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Reminder: this facility is for emergency use only.  It wakes people up.</p></div>
